*Now that you have seen how to pull a container image and run a container, let's try a challenge.*

Can you pull the **16.04** version of the **Ubuntu** image and then run the ``ps`` command within the context of a container using that image?

> **Hint**: Remember that you can specify the command to run within the context of the container when you run the container using the CLI.

## Requirements

To complete this challenge you must:

- Pull the **Ubuntu** container image using the specific **16.04** version.
- Run the **ps** command within the context of a container using the image described above.
